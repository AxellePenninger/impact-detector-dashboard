# Impact Detector Dashboard

This is a web application that provides a dashboard for monitoring and analyzing crashes during a pro cycling race. It gives the medical team more information about the crashes, including the number of riders involved, the severity of the crash, and the location of the crash.

Right now, the application is in an early stage of development and only contains a frontend. The backend is not yet implemented, but the frontend is fully functional and can be used to visualize the data.
